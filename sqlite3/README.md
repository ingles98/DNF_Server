# SQLite3 for Lua
An SQLite3 Library for Lua

##Installation and Setup
- Download **sqlite3.lua**.

- Copy the **sqlite3.lua** file to your project.

- Edit the **sqlite3.lua** file and set the *SQLite3Path* variable in the **tSettings** table to the directory where the Sqlite3 plugin can write the library file. 

*Note*: the application **must** have write access to the path. The user data folder is usually a good place for the Sqlite3 plugin to write the library file.

There are various ways to do this depending on what system is being used. For example, if you're using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), you can simply type **love.filesystem.getSaveDirectory()**.

- Require the scipt file.
```lua
require('pathtoyourscripts.sqlite3');
```
##Usage Example
```lua  
    --create/open database
    local hDB = sqlite3.open("mydatabase.db");

      if hDB then
      local sQuery = "CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY   AUTOINCREMENT, name CHAR(20));";
      hDB:execute(sQuery);
      
      hDB:close();
      end
```
